This is a repo of Dashboards

# How to Copy a Dashboard
Create the dashboard in search and reporting giving it a unique name. The name MAY be important if you are creating a drilldown SET of dashboards. Follow the instructions in the given directory

After you create the dashboard it will send you to the editing of it. Copy the TEXT of dashboardSource.txt

Replace the variables to fit your environment, most notably the INDEX. If you use the Default index for your Add-On you may need to remove that from the querries.
